        <p>This vegetable stir-fry is something I whipped up one day when I felt like a stir-fry but did not have all the ingredients called for in some of the stir-fry recipes on this site. I used certain vegetables I had on hand, but any seasonal veggies may be used. It has a mild ginger flavor that can be enhanced according to taste, and is filling yet light on the tummy! Tofu may be added. Serve over a bed of steamed jasmine rice.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons vegatable oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger root, divided</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 small head broccoli, cut into florets</li>
            <li>3/4 cup julienned carrots</li>
            <li>1/2 cup snow peas</li>
            <li>1/2 cup halved green beans</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon ginger, garlic, and cornstarch in a large bowl; mix until cornstarch is dissolved. Add broccoli, carrots, snow peas, and green beans; toss lightly to coat.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Add vegetable mixture and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent burning.</li>
